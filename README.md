Please update API Key in Strings.xml

I used this project as an opportunity to work out many topics covered in lesssons 1-4 (remaining ones are to be added in stage 2 code). 

Therefore in this project I tried to apply certain things not required in project specifications.

I used followings when preparing this project:

1. Image download and display:  I figured out how to use Picasso library myself (without looking at any other project) by following guidance provided in Popular Movies App Implementation Guide;

2. Movie data fetching:  I used code in "ForecastFragment.java"  class  of "Sunshine-Version-2-2.09_display_data" version of Sunshine project (used only this java class code)   -  I modified it to fetch data from themoviedb.org ;

3. Shared preferences to save settings: App memorises last sorting option used and launches app using this sorting option next time it is launched.  I did NOT use SharedPreferences implementation provided in Sunshine project. Instead I used code provided in https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal

4. SQL: I used example given in 
http://www.androidhive.info/2013/09/android-sqlite-database-with-multiple-tables/

to store info in SQL database to improve knowledge of working with databases.
